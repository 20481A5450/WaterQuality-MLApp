# Water Quality Machine Learning Application

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning application for water quality analysis. The application utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict water quality based on input parameters such as pH level, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. It also includes features for data visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: The application preprocesses raw water quality data, including handling missing values and scaling features.
- Model Training: It trains machine learning models using various algorithms such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and others to predict water quality.
- Evaluation Metrics: The application provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of trained models.
- Data Visualization: It offers visualizations of water quality data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into the dataset.
- Google Sheets Integration: The application integrates with the Google Sheets API to facilitate data import/export and collaboration.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: 
```bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/water-quality-app.git```
2. Install dependencies: ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Set up MySQL database and configure the settings in ```bash settings.py```
4. Run migrations: ```bash python manage.py migrate```
5. Start the development server: ```bash python manage.py runserver```

## Usage
1. Upload Water Quality Data: Import water quality data into the application.
2. Preprocess Data: Preprocess the data to handle missing values and scale features.
3. Train Models: Train machine learning models using different algorithms.
4. Evaluate Models: Evaluate the performance of trained models using various evaluation metrics.
5. Visualize Data: Visualize water quality data to gain insights and identify patterns.
